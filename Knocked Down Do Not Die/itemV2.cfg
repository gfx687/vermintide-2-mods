description = "Players that have been knocked down are invulnerable and invisible (to not take aggro).

Revival of such players will take longer, however:
- if player just died it will take the normal amount of time

- if more than 10s - revive will take 10 seconds

NOTE! Both Clients and the HOST need to have this mod.
