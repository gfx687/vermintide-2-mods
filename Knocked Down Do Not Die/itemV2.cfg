description = "Players that have been knocked down are invulnerable and invisible (to not take aggro).

Revival of such players will take longer, however:
- if player just died it will take the normal amount of time
- if more than 5 seconds passed - twice as long (4 seconds)
- if more than 10s - revive will take 10 seconds

HOST and CLIENT:
1) HOST must have a mod for mod to work (obviously)
2) HOST can disable the mod in F4 menu and it will be disabled properly
3) CLIENT does NOT have to install the mod for it to work.  
    They will not see correct revive progress however. Meaning revive bar will fill in 2 seconds but you will need to hold for 8 seconds more after.  
    Installing the mod makes progress show properly.
4) If CLIENT has the mod but HOST doesn't then there will be no issues for neither.

TL;DR - client can have mod ON at all times regardless of HOST having the mod or not.

FAQ:
- My teammate or I died in an inaccessible location. What to do?
Command /die has been added for this case which will kill the player that used it.
