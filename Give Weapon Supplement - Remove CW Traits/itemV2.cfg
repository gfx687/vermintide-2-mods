title = "Give Weapon Supplement - Remove CW Traits";
description = "Mod adds an option to remove Chaos Wastes traits from Give Weapon drop-down options.

Why? - Because after latest update to CW amount of traits in the game increased. Currently Give Weapon cannot show all the traits on 1080p resolution. 

P.S. This mod is NOT a replacement for Give Weapon. It is intended to be used together with it.
P.S.S. Option to remove SW traits is in THIS mod's options, not in Give Weapon's.";
