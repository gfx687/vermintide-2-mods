title = "More Specials";
description = "Change number of specials present in the game.

Commands:
/more_specials - Enable/disable mod. Disabling mod will return specials number to difficulty's default.

HOW TO USE WITH ONSLAUGHT:
1) enable onslaught variation first
2) enable /more_specials second
3) enjoy your games
4) disable /more_specials first
5) disable onslaught variation second

If you enabled mods in the wrong order, then it is better to restart the game, because specials settings will be messed up.

P.S. you can safely disable-enable more_specials mod multiple times on steps 2-4 to change it's settings. As long as general order of enabling/disabling onslaught and more_specials is the same.
