title = "Revive Speed Improved";
description = "Makes Revive Speed trinket property affect following interactions:
  - Pulling someone up from the ledge
  - Assisting in revive (after player respawned)
  - Releasing player from hook's pole
  
NOTE: HOST-side mod. Only takes effect if host has the mod. 
So even if you are client without the mod, but host enabled it - you will get faster interactions (assuming you have property on trinket).";
